# ComputeShader_Example

An old tutorial for teaching how to use compute shaders that I downloaded a couple of years ago. I had updated it so that it would compile from checkout at the time (old code references some deprecated stuff).


I did not create the original code and I no longer know where the original source came from. I have a feeling it might have been a microsoft tutorial from MSDN.

This project is not maintained. It exists as a standalone example for compute shaders, as such it is archived to reflect that there will be no further changes.
