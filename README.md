# ComputeShader_Example
An old tutorial for teaching how to use compute shaders that I updated to compile from checkout (old code references some deprecated stuff). 

I did not create the original code and I no longer know where the original source came from. I have a feeling it might have been a microsoft tutorial from MSDN.
